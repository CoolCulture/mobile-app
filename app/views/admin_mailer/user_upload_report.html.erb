    <h3>Thanks for uploading new users, <%= @user.email %>.</h3>
    
    <% if @success %>
      <p>
        Overall, you successfully uploaded <%= @success.count %> new users. Attached you will find a CSV with the new users and their passwords. Please email them out directly.

    <% if @errors %>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, some users couldn't be uploaded for a variety of reasons. Please separate out these users into a new spreadsheet and try re-importing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <% @errors.each do |pass_id, error| %>
          <li><%= pass_id %>: <%= error %></li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
    <% end %>
